# Wine-Quality-Predictor

This project focuses on predicting the quality of red wine based on its various physicochemical properties using machine learning models. It includes exploratory data analysis, model training, performance comparison, and a practical application for predicting wine quality from user-provided inputs.


Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict the numerical wine quality score (ranging from 0-10) using the `winequality-red.csv` dataset. Through comprehensive data analysis and model evaluation, we aim to identify effective algorithms for this prediction task. A key feature of this updated project is the ability to predict wine quality interactively based on user-provided physicochemical properties.
